# ðŸš— Uber Rides Data Analysis using Python

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
This project analyzes Uber ride data to uncover patterns, demand trends, and optimization opportunities.  
Using **Python**, **Pandas**, **Matplotlib**, and **Seaborn**, we perform end-to-end **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** to generate actionable business insights.  

The dataset contains trip details such as pickup times, locations, and trip durations.  
Through visualization and statistical analysis, we identify:
- Peak hours & days
- Most popular pickup zones
- Seasonal/temporal ride patterns

## ðŸŽ¯ Objective
To analyze Uber rides data and answer:
1. When are the busiest hours for Uber rides?
2. Which locations have the highest demand?
3. Are there seasonal or weekday/weekend trends?
4. How can Uber optimize driver allocation for better efficiency?
